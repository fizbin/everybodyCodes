# What is this

This is a repository I'm creating to track solutions to problems on
[Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes/), a programming problem
site I discovered in early 2025 and am as of this writing working through.

# Layout

I intend to put each "event" on the site into its own subdirectory; each
event subdirectory will then further have a subdirectory call `input` and
subdirectories for each language I want to do this in.

# License

In this repository, I'm going to say ALL RIGHTS RESERVED with regard to other
use of any of this code. Obviously, I intend other humans to look at my
solutions and learn from them, but I explicitly DO NOT grant any license to
use this code for training LLM-based "AI" models nor do I grant anyone rights
to copy-and-paste anything out of here into another project. Consider this
code licensed to you like code you found in a textbook: you can read it, and
if you're Github you can distribute it to the bare minimum necessary to run
the github service and let other humans read the code, but that's it.

As a small, tiny exception: if you, a natural person, would find it useful for
your own educational purposes (that is, for *you learning* something, but not
for *you teaching* something) to make a local copy so that you can examine it
in a local editor or run the code with a local debugger or profiler, that's
allowed for as long as is needed until you've learned everything you can from
the code.
